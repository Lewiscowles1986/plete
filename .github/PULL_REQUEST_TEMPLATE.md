<!--
 #### Background (Problem in detail)  - optional
-->

<!--
 #### Solution  - optional
-->
<!--
> When contributing code (and not just fixing typos, documentation and configuration), please describe why/how your solution works. This helps reviewers spot any mistakes in the implementation.
>
> Example:
> "This solution works by adding a `paintBlue()` method"
> Then your reviewer might spot a mistake in the implementation, if `paintBlue()` uses the colour red.
>
> Where possible: a before and after gif if appropriate for visual changes would be much appreciated.
